# Kubernetes Conditions Integration for SR-IOV Network Operator CRDs

## Summary

This proposal enhances the observability and operational transparency of the SR-IOV Network Operator by integrating standard Kubernetes conditions into the status of its key Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This enables users and automated systems to easily understand the current state, progress, and health of SR-IOV network configurations and components directly through Kubernetes API objects.

## Motivation

Adding Kubernetes conditions to the SR-IOV Network Operator's CRDs is crucial for several reasons:

* **Improved Observability:** Conditions provide a standardized, machine-readable way to convey the state of a resource, including its readiness, progress, and any encountered issues. This allows for better monitoring and debugging.

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can quickly ascertain the health and status of their `SriovNetwork`, `SriovIBNetwork`, `OVSNetwork`, `SriovNetworkNodeState`, `SriovOperatorConfig`, `SriovNetworkNodePolicy`, and `SriovNetworkPoolConfig` resources without needing to delve into logs or complex operator-specific status fields.

* **Standardized API Interaction:** Aligning with Kubernetes' best practices for API object status makes the SR-IOV operator more consistent with other Kubernetes operators and native resources, simplifying integration with existing tooling (e.g., `kubectl wait`, Prometheus alerts).

* **Automated Remediation and Orchestration:** External controllers or automation tools can reliably react to changes in resource conditions, enabling more robust and intelligent orchestration workflows and automated problem resolution.

* **Clearer Error Reporting:** Specific conditions can indicate different types of errors (e.g., `Degraded`, `Ready`, `Progressing`), providing more granular insight into failures.

* **Simplified Troubleshooting:** When a resource is not in the desired state, conditions can point directly to the reason, accelerating troubleshooting.

### Use Cases

1. **Network Resource Provisioning Status:**
   - A user creates a `SriovNetwork`, `SriovIBNetwork`, or `OVSNetwork` custom resource
   - Condition `Ready` is set to `True` once the network is successfully provisioned and ready for use by pods
   - Condition `Degraded` is set to `True` with a reason if the network provisioning fails

2. **Node Configuration Health:**
   - The operator updates the `SriovNetworkNodeState` for a node
   - Condition `Progressing` when the operator is applying changes to the node's SR-IOV configuration
   - Condition `Degraded` if a node's SR-IOV configuration is incorrect
   - Condition `Ready` indicating the overall readiness of the SR-IOV components on that specific node
   - Drain-specific conditions (`DrainProgressing`, `DrainDegraded`, `DrainComplete`) for tracking drain operations

3. **Operator Configuration Status:**
   - An administrator modifies the `SriovOperatorConfig`
   - Condition `Ready` indicates that the operator's components are running and healthy
   - Condition `Degraded` if the operator itself encounters issues

4. **Policy Configuration Management:**
   - An administrator creates or updates a `SriovNetworkNodePolicy`
   - Condition `Ready` indicates that the policy configuration has been successfully applied to all target nodes
   - Condition `Progressing` when the policy configuration is being applied to the selected nodes
   - Condition `Degraded` if any matched nodes are in a degraded state
   - Status includes `matchedNodeCount` and `readyNodeCount` for aggregated visibility

5. **Pool Configuration Management:**
   - An administrator creates or updates a `SriovNetworkPoolConfig`
   - Condition `Ready` indicates that the pool configuration has been successfully applied to all target nodes
   - Condition `Progressing` when the pool configuration is being applied to the selected nodes
   - Condition `Degraded` if the pool configuration fails to apply or conflicts with existing configurations
   - Status includes `matchedNodeCount` and `readyNodeCount` for aggregated visibility

### Goals

* Add standard Kubernetes conditions to all major SR-IOV CRDs (`SriovNetwork`, `SriovIBNetwork`, `OVSNetwork`, `SriovNetworkNodeState`, `SriovOperatorConfig`, `SriovNetworkNodePolicy`, `SriovNetworkPoolConfig`)
* Implement consistent condition types across all CRDs where applicable
* Ensure conditions are updated in real-time as resource states change
* Maintain backward compatibility with existing status fields
* Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for condition usage
* Enable `kubectl wait` functionality for all resources
* Add aggregated status for policy and pool resources showing matched/ready node counts

### Non-Goals

* Modifying existing status field structures (maintaining backward compatibility)
* Adding conditions to deprecated or legacy CRDs
* Implementing custom condition types beyond standard Kubernetes patterns
* Changing existing controller reconciliation logic beyond condition updates

## Implementation

### Condition Types

The following condition types are implemented across SR-IOV CRDs:

```go
const (
    // ConditionProgressing indicates that the resource is being actively reconciled
    ConditionProgressing = "Progressing"
    
    // ConditionDegraded indicates that the resource is not functioning as expected
    ConditionDegraded = "Degraded"
    
    // ConditionReady indicates that the resource has reached its desired state and is fully functional
    ConditionReady = "Ready"

    // Drain-specific conditions for SriovNetworkNodeState
    
    // ConditionDrainProgressing indicates that the node is being actively drained
    ConditionDrainProgressing = "DrainProgressing"

    // ConditionDrainDegraded indicates that the drain process is not functioning as expected
    ConditionDrainDegraded = "DrainDegraded"

    // ConditionDrainComplete indicates that the drain operation completed successfully
    ConditionDrainComplete = "DrainComplete"
)
```

### Condition Reasons

The following reasons are used across conditions:

```go
const (
    // Reasons for Ready condition
    ReasonNetworkReady   = "NetworkReady"
    ReasonNodeReady      = "NodeConfigurationReady"
    ReasonNodeDrainReady = "NodeDrainReady"
    ReasonOperatorReady  = "OperatorReady"
    ReasonNotReady       = "NotReady"

    // Reasons for Degraded condition
    ReasonProvisioningFailed           = "ProvisioningFailed"
    ReasonConfigurationFailed          = "ConfigurationFailed"
    ReasonNetworkAttachmentDefNotFound = "NetworkAttachmentDefinitionNotFound"
    ReasonNetworkAttachmentDefInvalid  = "NetworkAttachmentDefinitionInvalid"
    ReasonNamespaceNotFound            = "NamespaceNotFound"
    ReasonHardwareError                = "HardwareError"
    ReasonDriverError                  = "DriverError"
    ReasonOperatorComponentsNotHealthy = "OperatorComponentsNotHealthy"
    ReasonNotDegraded                  = "NotDegraded"

    // Reasons for Progressing condition
    ReasonConfiguringNode       = "ConfiguringNode"
    ReasonApplyingConfiguration = "ApplyingConfiguration"
    ReasonCreatingVFs           = "CreatingVFs"
    ReasonLoadingDriver         = "LoadingDriver"
    ReasonDrainingNode          = "DrainingNode"
    ReasonNotProgressing        = "NotProgressing"

    // Reasons for DrainComplete condition
    ReasonDrainCompleted = "DrainCompleted"
    ReasonDrainNotNeeded = "DrainNotNeeded"
    ReasonDrainPending   = "DrainPending"

    // Reasons for DrainDegraded condition
    ReasonDrainFailed = "DrainFailed"

    // Reasons for Policy/PoolConfig conditions
    ReasonPolicyReady                = "PolicyReady"
    ReasonPolicyNotReady             = "PolicyNotReady"
    ReasonNoMatchingNodes            = "NoMatchingNodes"
    ReasonPartiallyApplied           = "PartiallyApplied"
    ReasonAllNodesConfigured         = "AllNodesConfigured"
    ReasonSomeNodesFailed            = "SomeNodesFailed"
    ReasonSomeNodesProgressing       = "SomeNodesProgressing"
)
```

### Implementation Details

#### Status Patcher Package (pkg/status)

A new `pkg/status` package provides utilities for managing CRD status updates:

```go
// Interface defines methods for updating resource status with retry logic and event emission
type Interface interface {
    // UpdateStatus updates the status of a resource with retry on conflict
    UpdateStatus(ctx context.Context, obj client.Object, updateFunc func() error) error

    // PatchStatus patches the status of a resource with retry on conflict
    PatchStatus(ctx context.Context, obj client.Object, patch client.Patch) error

    // UpdateStatusWithEvents updates status and emits events for condition transitions
    UpdateStatusWithEvents(ctx context.Context, obj client.Object, oldConditions, newConditions []metav1.Condition, updateFunc func() error) error

    // SetCondition sets a condition with the given type, status, reason, and message
    SetCondition(conditions *[]metav1.Condition, conditionType string, status metav1.ConditionStatus, reason, message string, generation int64)

    // IsConditionTrue checks if a condition exists and has status True
    IsConditionTrue(conditions []metav1.Condition, conditionType string) bool

    // FindCondition returns the condition with the given type, or nil if not found
    FindCondition(conditions []metav1.Condition, conditionType string) *metav1.Condition

    // HasConditionChanged checks if the new condition differs from the existing one
    HasConditionChanged(conditions []metav1.Condition, conditionType string, status metav1.ConditionStatus, reason, message string) bool
}
```

#### Transition Detection

The package includes transition detection for automatic event emission:

```go
// TransitionType represents the type of condition transition
type TransitionType string

const (
    TransitionAdded     TransitionType = "Added"
    TransitionChanged   TransitionType = "Changed"
    TransitionRemoved   TransitionType = "Removed"
    TransitionUnchanged TransitionType = "Unchanged"
)

// DetectTransitions compares old and new conditions and returns a list of transitions
func DetectTransitions(oldConditions, newConditions []metav1.Condition) []Transition
```

#### Helper Functions

The `api/v1/conditions.go` file provides shared helper functions:

```go
// ConditionsEqual compares two condition slices ignoring LastTransitionTime.
// This is useful to avoid unnecessary API updates when conditions haven't actually changed.
func ConditionsEqual(a, b []metav1.Condition) bool
```

#### Controller Integration

Each controller uses the status patcher to update conditions:

**Network Controllers (SriovNetwork, SriovIBNetwork, OVSNetwork):**
- Set `Ready=True, Degraded=False` on successful NAD provisioning
- Set `Ready=False, Degraded=True` when namespace not found or provisioning fails

**SriovOperatorConfig Controller:**
- Set `Ready=True, Degraded=False` on successful reconciliation
- Set `Ready=False, Degraded=True` on component failures

**Config Daemon:**
- Updates `SriovNetworkNodeState` conditions during sync operations
- Sets configuration conditions based on sync status

**Drain Controller:**
- Sets drain-specific conditions during drain operations
- Updates `DrainProgressing`, `DrainDegraded`, `DrainComplete` based on drain state

**Status Controllers (Policy and PoolConfig):**
- Dedicated controllers aggregate conditions from matching `SriovNetworkNodeState` objects
- Watches changes to NodeStates and Nodes to update aggregated status

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Check network status
kubectl get sriovnetwork -o wide
NAME          READY   DEGRADED   AGE
my-network    True    False      5m

# Wait for network to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready sriovnetwork/my-network --timeout=60s

# Check policy status with node counts
kubectl get sriovnetworknodepolicy -o wide
NAME        MATCHED   READY NODES   READY   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   AGE
policy1     3         3             True    False         False      10m

# Check pool config status
kubectl get sriovnetworkpoolconfig -o wide
NAME          MATCHED   READY NODES   READY   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   AGE
worker-pool   5         5             True    False         False      15m

# Check node state with all conditions
kubectl get sriovnetworknodestate -o wide
NAME      SYNC STATUS   READY   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   DRAINPROGRESS   DRAINDEGRADED   DRAINCOMPLETE   AGE
worker1   Succeeded     True    False         False      False           False           True            1h
```

### Backward Compatibility

* Existing status fields are preserved
* Conditions are added as optional fields
* Controllers continue to update legacy status fields alongside conditions
* Client code relying on existing status fields is not affected

### Error Handling

* Condition updates use retry logic with conflict handling (up to 3 retries)
* Failed condition updates are logged but don't cause reconciliation failure
* Conditions are updated atomically using Patch operations to avoid race conditions

### Upgrade & Downgrade Considerations

#### Upgrade
* New CRD versions with condition fields are backward compatible
* Existing CR instances continue to function without conditions
* Controllers start populating conditions immediately after upgrade
* No manual intervention required from users

#### Downgrade
* Conditions are ignored by older controller versions
* Existing status fields continue to be populated
* No data loss or functionality degradation during downgrade
* CRD structure remains compatible with older API versions

## Testing

The implementation includes:

* **Unit tests** for all condition handling logic
* **Unit tests** for status patcher and transition detection
* **Integration tests** for controller condition updates
* **E2E conformance tests** validating conditions in real cluster scenarios
